# Discord.py Basics by FStrike7
### Basic python templates to set-up your bot

#### "discordpy_basics" is my first public repo where I want to share basic python files to set-up your custom Bot, just changing minimal things.

The main purpose of these scripts is making them with few external libraries, mainly using native python libraries, such as sqlite3, os, etc.

For the moment, the repo consists of:
- Cog's classes *(to make the project be loose coupling and avoid changes in many files)*.
- SQL implementation.
- Economy System based on SQL Database.
- Poll implementation to allow users to make interactive polls.
- Embed format to all bot's messages.

I'll write a lot of comments ( using # ) on the scripts to make it easier to understand when editing them.

_Keep in mind that, although GitHub allows me to make this type of "Readme" files, it is not easy for me to explain specific segments of the script and I must resort to make comment inside the code._
